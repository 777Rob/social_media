Participatory social media platform
 
Modern social media platforms from our point of view:
 
Here we give a general overview of the features modern social media platforms carry and why we think these need to change and adapt.
 
Centralised governance 
Modern social media platforms are usually managed by one giant corporation, which decides on the use and fate of user data and the platform's future. As a result, the platform's evolution is determined by high-ranking managers and directors of the firm, while the opinions of casual everyday users are often left behind. Consequently, the way that the platform evolves might not reflect majorities wishes. 

Moving on, social media giants tend to gather and store vast amounts of personal user data, which provides them with opportunities to:
Manipulate gathered data via sophisticated algorithms and target users with political advertisements or influential ads.
Keep personal user data in the database for unlimited time. This action allows corporations to make future assumptions and analyse general users' behaviour in particular cases.
Be victims of mass data breaches or engage in selling user privacy. For example, $Facebook's scandal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FacebookCambridge_Analytica_data_scandal), where political data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica obtained personal information, containing details about where users lived and what pages they liked, from over 100 million people. This information was later deployed in political campaigns and influenced the 2016 US President Election and Brexit results.
 
Hidden structure and algorithms
The system’s operation is hidden from users and is only available for the authorised personnel without the ability to share the working mechanisms with other people. Such a system imposes a lack of transparency. People trust the company but are not allowed to know how their data is used, how their content is being prioritised, how the system chooses which posts to show to the user and what data/assumptions make it do it the way it does. Secret algorithms also give space to privacy integrity breaches: posts may be stored in the database even if the user decides to remove them. 

The main flaw with this is that platform users do not know how their data is handled. The idea to keep users in the unknown in terms of what is happening under the bonnet inside the program imposes an inequality among users: why posts of some users are more promoted than posts of others?

If we pretend that we live in a democratic world, all people should be treated as equals and be able to express their opinion freely (as long as it complies with the law). Besides, there should be no place for promoting some people's opinions more than others based on their status or how much monetary value they bring.
 
“Democracy is fundamentally undermined if we fail to adhere to free speech principles.”
-Elon Musk
 
 
Little to no power to everyday users
Nowadays, it is typical for corporate leaders to decide what updates to implement and how to change the platform's working mechanisms. What if we take that power from them and give it to the actual users and let them decide the platform’s future and how they would like it to be? What if we let users choose what ads they want to see instead of being driven by generating corporate revenue by displaying various ads, not caring whether it interests the user or not?

---

Above mentioned grounds do not go well with present-day user expectations. What modern users desire is to be their own data masters.

In other words, they want to choose who can access their data and, if preferred, stop them from accessing it while at the same time being sure that their data is cryptographically secure and can be anonymised.

Moreover, users want to see how the platform operates to be guaranteed that it is protected and does not misbehave. 

In addition, contemporary users wish to be treated as equals in a democratic world and be able to make decisions and participate in the evolvement process together with others.

Hence, we propose an alternative social media platform based on blockchain technology that overcomes these flaws and brings many other benefits for everyday users.
 
Features of our proposed system:
    
Open-sourced code
The platform’s code and algorithms are visible publicly, allowing users to see what is happening within the system - how posts are handled, how algorithms operate, and how the system chooses which ads to display. As a result, any attempts to manipulate user data or malfunction will not go unnoticed.
 
Free speech and equality
People are free to express themselves in any way they want if their behaviour complies with the law. Besides, every user is equal in their record weight and the ability to post advertisements.
 
Private data security and anonymity
Users can choose whether they want to disclose their personal information (make it visible to others) or remain anonymous. The system will not require people to state their details, such as first name or date of birth, but will keep it possible if the user wants to be identifiable. Anonymity and security are guaranteed by blockchain technology, where private data is protected by cryptography and hashing.
 
The platform’s future is decided by users
Being a valuable community member (posting $quality content, being active, helpful and supporting), a user can earn reputation points which later can be utilised in voting.

To exemplify, users can offer ideas for system improvement/modification. If their proposals pass $the minimal requirements margin and are considered non-damaging, they are put into the queue with other proposals for future voting. Every user has voting power proportional to the number of reputation points they have. Therefore, more reputation points equal more voting power. If a proposal passes a $minimal passing margin, it is put into the list with other tasks for upcoming updates.

By this, we make a system where users that are the most involved in the system and care about it the most decide what platform they want to use and how it should look in the future.

In addition, our user equality idea ensures that everyone has equal potential to earn reputation points and then participate in the platform's evolvement.

Users' activity is rewarded with tokens
Platform users can earn cryptocurrency for posting material decided by the community to be attractive, informative, engaging or relevant according to some other criteria.

Moreover, users also get rewards for spending time on a social media platform and seeing ads posted by other community members.

Finally, users can also get cryptocurrency actively engaging in commenting and voting for system update proposals.

Privacy integrity assurance
Users can be confident that we are not storing any of their personal information or data because such a thing as a centralised database will not exist. Instead, the system will use a decentralised alternative data storage where users will be able to choose who can access their information.

The system user has the full right to stop using the system at any time and be guaranteed that neither his data nor records will be accessible to anyone.

Relevant ads
Content is offered to users according to their wishes. Advertisements are displayed only those that are relevant (according to the categories followed by the user).

The user may refuse to see advertisements entirely or limit them to a level acceptable to him/her. In addition, users can rate every seen advertisement according to its relevance, thus improving the targeting algorithm.

Finally, any user can order ads to be posted by paying using the platform's cryptocurrency tokens.
