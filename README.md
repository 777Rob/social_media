# Parsedia - participatory social media platform

### Features of our proposed system:

---

#### Open-sourced code
  
The platform’s code and algorithms are visible publicly, allowing users to see what is happening within the system - how posts are handled, how             algorithms operate, and how the system chooses which ads to display. As a result, any attempts to manipulate user data or malfunction will not go   unnoticed.

#### Free speech and equality

People are free to express themselves in any way they want if their behaviour complies with the law. Besides, every user is equal in their record weight and the ability to post advertisements.

---

#### Private data security and anonymity

Users can choose whether they want to disclose their personal information (make it visible to others) or remain anonymous. The system will not require people to state their details, such as first name or date of birth, but will keep it possible if the user wants to be identifiable. Anonymity and security are guaranteed by blockchain technology, where private data is protected by cryptography and hashing.

#### The platform’s future is decided by users

Being a valuable community member (posting $quality content, being active, helpful and supporting), a user can earn reputation points which later can be utilised in voting.

To exemplify, users can offer ideas for system improvement/modification. If their proposals pass $the minimal requirements margin and are considered non-damaging, they are put into the queue with other proposals for future voting. Every user has voting power proportional to the number of reputation points they have. Therefore, more reputation points equal more voting power. If a proposal passes a $minimal passing margin, it is put into the list with other tasks for upcoming updates.

By this, we make a system where users that are the most involved in the system and care about it the most decide what platform they want to use and how it should look in the future.

In addition, our user equality idea ensures that everyone has equal potential to earn reputation points and then participate in the platform's evolvement.

#### Users' activity is rewarded with tokens

Platform users can earn cryptocurrency for posting material decided by the community to be attractive, informative, engaging or relevant according to some other criteria.

Moreover, users also get rewards for spending time on a social media platform and seeing ads posted by other community members.

Finally, users can also get cryptocurrency actively engaging in commenting and voting for system update proposals.

#### Privacy integrity assurance

Users can be confident that we are not storing any of their personal information or data because such a thing as a centralised database will not exist. Instead, the system will use a decentralised alternative data storage where users will be able to choose who can access their information.

The system user has the full right to stop using the system at any time and be guaranteed that neither his data nor records will be accessible to anyone.

---

#### Relevant ads

Content is offered to users according to their wishes. Advertisements are displayed only those that are relevant (according to the categories followed by the user).

The user may refuse to see advertisements entirely or limit them to a level acceptable to him/her. In addition, users can rate every seen advertisement according to its relevance, thus improving the targeting algorithm.

Finally, any user can order ads to be posted by paying using the platform's cryptocurrency tokens.
